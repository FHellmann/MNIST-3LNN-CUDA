# MNIST-3LNN-CUDA
3-Layer Neural Network for MNIST Handwriting Recognition with CUDA

Based on the blog [Simple 3-Layer Neural Network for MNIST Handwriting Recognition](https://mmlind.github.io/Simple_3-Layer_Neural_Network_for_MNIST_Handwriting_Recognition/) of Matt Lind.

## Dependencies
Depends on
- OpenCV 2
- TCLAP

## Build
1. Init the submodules:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
2. Build `yaml-cpp` as described in `yaml-cpp/install.txt`
   Note that it's sufficient to only build the project. Installing it is not necessary.
